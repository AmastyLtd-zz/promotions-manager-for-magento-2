### Magento 2 Promotions Manager key features
* Display **rule types / discount amounts** on the grid
* Save time on discount rules creation, **use duplication**
* **Enable, disable, delete** price rules in one place
* Use **mass actions and set priorities** to rules at a time

### Handle promo rules effectively
##### Use mass actions to manage rules expertly
The extension is aimed to shorten the time spent on shopping cart price rules creation and managing. Thus, by using it you won’t need to disable/enable/delete rules one by one, simply apply the **Mass Actions** > **Select All** or **Select Visible** and then choose the needed **Action**. Say you ran Groupon promos, the rules have expired and now you have to delete them. Manually? We have some other alternative, with this solution, you can delete useless rules in bulk keeping your Marketing Cart Price Rules grid in good order.

##### Get your rules priorities straight
Setting priorities for a price rule is half the battle, but if you can apply the needed priority in bulk, this is the way you save time for more urgent tasks. With this extension, you’ll do it in a few clicks: choose **Mass Actions** and then click the **Action** menu to choose either **Top** or **Lowest Priority**. 

##### Duplicate complex rules
If you tested and know the ‘Buy X get Y free (discount amount is Y)’ rule brings the best results for your store, why then you need to reinvent the wheel. Simply, duplicate the previous rule using the **Duplicate** action:

Maintain your time wisely and reduce the number of random errors.

##### Find all rule details on one grid

Apart from the basic rules info like ID, Rule, Coupon Code, Start, End, Status, Web Site, Priority, and Action, you can see three more columns, which can make good use for your admin users.

##### ‘Rule Type’ сolumn
In this column, an admin user can see what rule type is applied for this or that promotion. You can filter your shopping cart price rules by one of the three types, to find a needed set of promos faster. 

##### ‘Stop’ column
Through the column, your admin user can stop the processing of promos that are lower in priority with a click of a button.

##### 'Discount Amount' column
With the column, admin users can get the value of the discount in figures / percentage / number of items.
